## Copula

A word used to ==link the subject== of a sentence with a ==subject complement==, such as an adjective, noun, or pronoun that ==describes or identifies the subject==. The ==most common== copula in English is the verb "==to be==" in its various forms (am, is, are, was, were, etc.).

### Key points

1. **Function**:
   - The ==primary function== of a copula is to ==connect the subject to the predicate==, providing a ==grammatical link== that relates the subject to ==additional information== about it.
	   - **Example**: In the sentence "*She is a teacher*," "*is*" functions as a copula linking the subject "*She*" to the noun phrase "*a teacher*."

2. **Forms of the Copula "to be"**:
   - Present tense: am, is, are
   - Past tense: was, were
   - Past participle: been
   - Present participle: being
   - Infinitive: be

3. **Types of Complements**:
   - **Predicate Nominative (Noun)**: A ==noun or noun phrase== that ==renames or identifies== the subject. 
     - Example: "*He is a doctor.*"
   - **Predicate Adjective**: An ==adjective== that ==describes== the subject.
     - Example: "*The sky is blue.*"
   - **Predicate Pronoun**: A ==pronoun== that ==identifies== the subject.
     - Example: "*It is I.*"

4. **Other Copulative Verbs**:
   - While "to be" is the most common copula, ==other verbs can also serve as copulas== in specific contexts. These are sometimes called ==semi-copulas or linking verbs==.
   - Examples include: *seem, become, appear, feel, look, sound, taste, and smell*.
   - Example: "*She seems happy*" (where "*seems*" is a copulative verb linking "*she*" to "*happy*").

5. **Zero Copula**:
   - In ==some languages and dialects==, the copula can be ==omitted==, a phenomenon known as the zero copula.
   - Example in some varieties of English: "*She happy*" instead of "*She is happy.*"

6. **Role in Sentence Structure**:
   - The copula is essential in sentences where the ==main verb does not convey action== but rather ==a state or condition== of the subject.
   - It plays a ==crucial role== in [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/5. Sentences#Equative sentences\|equative sentences]] (where the subject is equated with the complement) and [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/5. Sentences#Attributive sentences\|attributive sentences]] (where the subject is attributed a property).

## Predicator

A predicator is a term used to refer to ==the main element of a clause or sentence== that expresses the ==action, state, or relationship described by the predicate==. The predicator is essentially the ==core of the predicate==, indicating ==what is happening to or by the subject of the sentence==. It is a broad term that encompasses ==verbs, verb phrases, and sometimes other elements== that serve as the central component of the predicate.

### Key points

1. **Function**:
   - The predicator conveys the ==main action, state, or relationship== described by the predicate of a sentence.
   - It provides the essential information about ==what is happening in the clause==.

2. **Forms**:
   - **Simple Predicators**: ==Single verbs== that directly express the ==action, state, or relationship==.
     - **Example**: In the sentence "*She runs*," "*runs*" is a simple predicator.
   - **Complex Predicators**: ==Verb phrases or combinations of words== that function together as the predicator.
     - Example: In the sentence "*He has been studying*," "*has been studying*" is a complex predicator.

3. **Types**:
   - **Verbal Predicators**: Consist of ==verbs or verb phrases==.
     - Example: "*She sings beautifully.*"
   - **Nominal Predicators**: Consist of ==nouns or noun phrases== that function as the ==main element of the predicate==, often linked by [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/4. Parts of Sentences#Copula\|copular verbs]] like "be."
     - Example: "*He is a doctor.*"
   - **Adjectival Predicators**: Consist of ==adjectives or adjective phrases== that ==describe== the subject.
     - Example: "*The sky looks clear.*"

4. **Role in Sentence Structure**:
   - Predicators play a central role in ==defining the nature of the predicate and its relationship== to the subject.
   - They can ==vary in complexity and form==, depending on the structure of the sentence.

5. **Semantic Roles**:
   - Predicators often ==assign specific semantic roles to the arguments== of the predicate, such as agent, patient, experiencer, or theme.
   - These roles help to ==define who is doing what to whom== in the context of the sentence.

6. **Grammatical Function**:
   - The predicator is typically the ==head of the predicate phrase== and carries the ==tense, aspect, and mood== information in many languages.

Understanding predicators is essential for analyzing sentence structure and meaning, as they represent the core elements that convey the main action, state, or relationship in a clause or sentence.
