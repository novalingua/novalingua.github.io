## Semantics

- the branch of [linguistics](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=68ec23b20c823977&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWILLMcrvIGYZpR_kzEdPqPSW9OFjJw:1716976821836&q=linguistics&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2YduMw31oSLpDvYxhqWvVK7WCWh_IerG4_vTlAQesbYUopzLTmXUSCK-Nxw8sZ-HOSyckKZHXujb4M5_FrSZnUDlJXlfM%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYhbaMzbKGAxXB9DgGHTKkASgQyecJegQIJBAO) and logic ==concerned with meaning==. There are a number of branches and [subbranches](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=68ec23b20c823977&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWILLMcrvIGYZpR_kzEdPqPSW9OFjJw:1716976821836&q=subbranches&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2YOIkvMEZhrCdE8upRDAuFxqpAL20044FeHW8HZrgkerYHo7CnqU9q0faKGHG_3-VTzhNZIMvbOjFohkBlE_JcJyM-Ckk%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYhbaMzbKGAxXB9DgGHTKkASgQyecJegQIJBAP) of semantics, including _formal semantics_, which studies the ==logical aspects of meaning==, such as sense, reference, implication, and logical form, [_lexical_](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=68ec23b20c823977&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWILLMcrvIGYZpR_kzEdPqPSW9OFjJw:1716976821836&q=lexical&si=ACC90nwUEXg6u2vxy-araGkF9MAxUh2ShaNdgXIZmAGg4uGtmKDYCMMJaPFaQXAOkEsRCfzy4SKIzqL0hfFoxFvqExUQ6aH285WpUZ0XvwxvM26aGYLO5-Y%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYhbaMzbKGAxXB9DgGHTKkASgQyecJegQIJBAQ) _semantics_, which studies ==word meanings and word relations==, and _conceptual semantics_, which studies the ==cognitive structure of meaning==.
- It examines ==what== meaning is, ==how== words ==get== their meaning, and ==how== the ==meaning== of a complex expression ==depends== on its ==parts==. Part of this process involves the distinction between sense and reference.

### Semantic space

A **semantic space** is a ==mathematical representation of relationships between words, phrases, or documents based on their meanings==. It's a way of ==mapping meaning onto a multidimensional space==, where the ==distance and direction== between points ==reflect the semantic similarity or difference== between the corresponding items.

- Different languages carve up [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#Semantic space\|#Semantic space]] differently
	- *know* in English can be translated to *wiem* or *znam* in Polish
	- *fazer* in Portuguese can be translated to *to make* or *to do* in English
- ==Further context is needed== about how a language carves up the [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#Semantic space\|#Semantic space]] in order to know which ==translation== to use

#### How it works

1. **Representation:** Each ==word, phrase, or document== is represented as a ==point or vector== in the semantic space.
2. **Dimensions:** The space has ==multiple dimensions==, each representing a ==different aspect of meaning== (e.g., topic, sentiment, connotation).
3. **Distance:** The ==distance between points== in the space indicates the ==semantic similarity== between the corresponding items. ==Closer== points represent ==more similar== meanings.
4. **Direction:** The ==direction between points== can represent different ==types of semantic relationships==, such as [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#^7990dc\|synonymy]], [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#^00ffa2\|antonymy]], or [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#^9bec3e\|hypernymy]] (is-a relationship).

#### Techniques

- **Distributional semantics:** Analyzing how words co-occur in large text corpora to infer their meanings.
- **Neural network models:** Training deep learning models to represent words and phrases as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
- **Latent semantic analysis (LSA):** A statistical technique that identifies latent (hidden) relationships between words and documents.

#### Applications

- **Information retrieval:** Improving search engine results by understanding the meaning behind queries and documents.
- **Machine translation:** Finding semantically equivalent words and phrases in different languages.
- **Natural language processing:** Enabling machines to understand and generate human language more effectively.
- **Recommendation systems:** Recommending items based on the semantic similarity between user preferences and item descriptions.

#### Examples

- In a semantic space for animals, "*dog*" and "*cat*" would be closer together than "*dog*" and "*fish*" because they share more semantic features.
- In a semantic space for emotions, "*happy*" and "*joyful*" would be closer together than "*happy*" and "sad*"* because they represent similar emotions.

## Definitions

- certain ==relationships between words==

### Semantic relationships

- **synonyms**: words with roughly the ==same definition==
{ #7990dc}

- **antonyms**: words with ==opposite definitions==
{ #00ffa2}

- **hyponyms**: words referring to a specific ==member of a broader category== (**subordinate**)
	- *spoon* is a hyponym of *cutlery*
- **hypernyms**: words with ==broad meaning that more specific words fall under== (**superordinate**)
{ #9bec3e}

	- *color* is a hypernym of *red*
- A ==hyponym of one word== can be a ==hypernym of another== & vice versa
- **homonyms**: words have the ==same spelling== (homographs) or the ==same pronunciation== (homophones), but ==different meanings and origins==
{ #dd2cea}


#### Definition shift

- words can ==become broader or narrower== in [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#Definitions\|#Definitions]]
- words can ==change meaning altogether==

#### Euphemisms

- words can be used as **euphemism** to ==avoid saying ruder words==
- **euphemism** start getting ==associated with the original meaning==, so ==another euphemism is needed==, so on

## Polysemy

- words with the ==same sequence of sounds== can have ==multiple meanings==, e.g. *bank*
- any [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#Definitions\|#Definitions]] start to ==break down== with ==exceptions and edge cases== (*sandwich*: *burrito*, *ice cream sandwich*)

## [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#^dd2cea\|Homonymy]] vs [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#Polysemy\|Polysemy]]

Homonymy and polysemy are ==both== linguistic phenomena that deal with ==words having multiple meanings==, but they differ in a fundamental way:

### Homonymy

- **Multiple Words:** Homonymy involves ==two or more distinct words== that happen to share the ==same form== (spelling and/or pronunciation).
- **Unrelated Meanings:** The ==meanings== of these words are ==entirely unrelated== and have ==different origins==.
- **Examples:**
    - _Bank_ (financial institution) vs. _bank_ (river edge)
    - _Bat_ (animal) vs. _bat_ (sports equipment)
- **Accidental Similarity:** Homonymy is often seen as an ==accidental similarity in form==, not a reflection of a deeper semantic connection.

### Polysemy

- **Single Word:** Polysemy refers to a single word that has ==multiple ***related*** meanings==.
- **Related Meanings:** The ==different meanings== of a polysemous word are ==interconnected== and share a ==common semantic origin==.
- **Examples:**
    - _Head_ (body part) vs. _head_ (leader) vs. _head_ (top of something)
    - _Run_ (move quickly) vs. _run_ (manage) vs. _run_ (flow)
- **Semantic Extension:** Polysemy ==arises through semantic extension or metaphorical processes==, where the ==original meaning== of a word ==expands== to encompass new, related concepts.

### Key Differences

|Feature|Homonymy|Polysemy|
|---|---|---|
|Number of words|Multiple words|Single word|
|Relationship between meanings|Unrelated|Related|
|Origin|Accidental similarity|Semantic extension|

### The Challenge of Distinction

Distinguishing between homonymy and polysemy can be tricky in some cases. The determination often relies on historical and etymological analysis, as well as considering native speaker intuitions about whether the meanings feel connected or not.

### Why it Matters

Understanding the difference between homonymy and polysemy is important for:

- **Lexicography:** Dictionary makers need to decide whether to list multiple meanings under one entry (polysemy) or create separate entries (homonymy).
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP systems need to disambiguate word senses to understand text correctly.
- **Language Learning:** Recognizing polysemous words can help learners understand the nuances of meaning and expand their vocabulary.

## Prototype theory

- rather than concrete, specific [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#Definitions\|#Definitions]] of words in our brains, we have ==prototypes== or ==exemplars== - the ==most typical representatives of a category==.
- ==not every word== has a prototype - *the*, *of*, *is*, etc. These are often [[Learning/Linguistics/Semantics/1. Semantics Basics#Function words\|#Function words]]

### Prototype

- **Central or ideal example:** A prototype represents ==the most typical or ideal example== of a category. A *robin* might be considered `a prototype of` the category *bird*.
- **Graded membership:** ==Categories== organized around prototypes ==exhibit graded membership==, meaning ==some members== are considered ==better examples== than others. A *penguin*, while still a *bird*, is `less prototypical` than a *robin*.
- **Cognitive representation:** Prototypes are thought to be `cognitive reference points` that help us ==categorize and understand the world==.

### Stereotype

- **Oversimplified generalization:** A stereotype is a ==fixed, oversimplified, and often biased belief about a group of people or things==. Stereotypes can be ==positive or negative==.
- **Social and cultural influence:** Stereotypes are often ==shaped by social norms, cultural values, and personal experiences==.
- **Potentially harmful:** Stereotypes can ==lead to prejudice and discrimination== when they are used to make assumptions about individuals based on their group membership.

### Key Differences

|Feature|Prototype|Stereotype|
|---|---|---|
|Nature|Cognitive representation of a typical example|Oversimplified belief about a group|
|Focus|Individual characteristics|Group characteristics|
|Formation|Based on observation and experience|Shaped by social and cultural factors|
|Effect|Helps with categorization and understanding|Can lead to prejudice and discrimination|

### Example

Consider the category "fruit." An apple might be a prototypical example, while a durian is less prototypical. However, a stereotype about fruit might be that they are all sweet, which is not true for all fruits.

While ==prototypes== can be ==useful for understanding categories==, it's important to be aware of the ==potential harm of stereotypes== and avoid making generalizations about individuals based on group characteristics.

## Function words

- Little words that **help a sentence fit together** grammatically
	- Can only be **described based on their relationship to the words they're used with** - their **function** in a sentence

### Predicate calculus

- AKA first-order logic, quantificational logic, first-order predicate calculus
- branch of **formal semantics** (semantics using formula)
- find meanings of certain words in **true sentences**

- **universal** quantifier: all, every
- **existential** quantifier: a, one
